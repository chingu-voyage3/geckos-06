## Welcome to our team!

Our members are:

  * **Regina M** (Project Manager)
  * **Davidbond813**  
  * **Slacker-Alt**
  * [**Tony Whomever**](https://github.com/Soupedenuit)
 
 Our goal is to work together as a remote team and build an **employee scheduling application**
 
 <ins>**Application summary:**</ins><br />
 An application to easily generate a part-time employee schedule based on employees' availability and needs of business.
 This application could be useful not only to employers but to anyone organizing a schedule for a group of people (i.e. volunteers).
 
 <ins>**Project User Story**</ins>
 * user can add a list of employee names
 * user can indicate business hours for each day of the week
 * user can indicate number of employees required at once
 * user can indicate min/max number of shifts per employee
 * user can indicate length of shifts
 * user can indicate length of breaks
 * user can indicate min/max hours per employee per day/week
 * once all required parameters are entered, the app will make an employee schedule for one week
