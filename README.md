 Our goal is to work together as a remote team and build an **employee scheduling application**
 
 <ins>**Application summary:**</ins><br />
 An application to easily generate a part-time employee schedule based on employees' availability and needs of business.
 This application could be useful not only to employers but to anyone organizing a schedule for a group of people (i.e. volunteers).
 
 <ins>**Project User Story**</ins>
 * user can add a list of employee names
 * user can indicate business hours for each day of the week
